# Digit Identification
Hi folks, this repositiry has a simple approach towards solving challenge of Digit Idnetification.
I have tried to implement a neural network to recognise digits.
### Data Set 
The data set used for this problem is from the popular MNIST data set. Developed by Yann LeCun, Corina Cortes and Christopher Burger for evaluating machine learning model on the handwritten digit classification problem. It is a widely used data set in the machine learning community. 
### Tools
R Studio and excel
### Methodology
I divided total 70000 images into two groups train and test, in tarin there are 49000 images and in test i have 21000 images.
So i trained 10 neurons on train images and then tested mu neural network on test images, although error rates are high i mean my model 
was showing accuracy of 25% in a hackathon , but still it can be a good referrence for beginner.
